To get started with this application, follow these steps:

1- Clone the repository to your local machine:

2- Install the dependencies:
```npm install```

3- Run the development server:

The application will be available at *http://localhost:3000*.

### Redux

This application uses Redux for state management. The Redux store is created in src/store.js, and the root reducer is located in src/reducers/rootReducer.js.

Actions are defined in src/actions, and reducers are located in src/reducers.

The application uses the react-redux library to connect the Redux store to the React components.

To build the CSS, run the following command:

```npm run build:css```

To apply the styles to the application, include the generated CSS file in the index.html file:

```<link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/style.css">```


### Deployment

To build the application for production, run the following command:

```npm run build```

This will create a production-ready build in the build directory. You can then deploy this build to a web server or hosting platform of your choice.
